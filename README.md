# Educational App

An primary school is looking to improve their online offering of educational content by developing some interactive apps that display information in a fun and interesting way.

Your task is to make an MVP to put forward to them - this may only be for a small set of information, and may only showcase some of the features to be included in the final app. You might use an API to bring in content or a database to store facts. The topic of the app is your choice, but here are some suggestions you could look into:

Interactive timeline, e.g. of the history of computer programming
Interactive map of a historical event - e.g. World War 1, the travels of Christopher Columbus

## MVP

Display some information about a particular topic in an interesting way
Have some user interactivity using event listeners, e.g to move through different sections of content

Some samples of existing apps for inspiration:

    http://education.iceandsky.com/
    http://histography.io - may only work in Safari
    http://worldpopulationhistory.org/map/1838/mercator/1/0/24/


### To get the app up and running:

- cd into kidz_who_code_api

- npm install

- still in terminal enter: PORT=3001 npm start

- in another terminal tab cd into kidz_who_code_frontend/client

- npm install

- npm start

- the endpoint for the json is http://localhost:3001/facts
